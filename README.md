# Sign-Language-Translator-

AIM:

To create a sign language converter which will help speech impaired people to
communicate with other normal people and to make a PCB for the system.

Basic Idea:

The basic idea of the project was to create such a system which would display on
screen what a speech impaired person wants to say. The project will help a lot of
speech impaired people and this project is for social cause.Sign language is a visual
language that is used by deaf and dumb people as their mother tongue. Unlike
acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual
communication to fluidly convey the thoughts of a person. It is achieved by
simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms
or body, and facial expressions. It can be used by a person who has difficulties in
speaking or by a person who can hear but could not speak and by normal people to
communicate with hearing disabled people. As far as a deaf person is concerned,
having access to a sign language is very important for their social, emotional and
linguistic growth. Sign language should be recognized as the first language of deaf
people and their education can be proceeded bilingually in the national sign language as
well as national written or spoken language. Indian Sign Language is used by deaf,
dumb and hard of hearing people for communication by showing signs using different
parts of body.
